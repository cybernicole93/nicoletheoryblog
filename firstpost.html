      Trans exclusionary radical pseudo feminism is the latest thing for cisgender allies to denounce and offer crude analysis of for woke points. In this essay, inspired by the 1989 essay "Kant, Capital and Incest Prohibition: a Critical Introduction to The Composition of Modernity" I will argue that trans exclusionary feminism, along with most exclusionry social justice movements, are motivated by what Nietzsche called resentiment and slave morality. I shall also show how rediculous truscum and pickme claims really are.

      In the essay "Anti-Christ" Nietzsche breks thoughly with earlier praise of "Christ" (see: Human, all too Human) to write a damning critique of Christ and the gosples.  H. L. MENCKEN   in his excellent introduction to the 1918 ALFRED A. KNOPF edition of Anti-Christ explains how this is in contrast to the picture painted by Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche: 
</br>
      <blockquote>
      One notes, in her biography of him—a useful but not always accurate work—an evident desire to purge him of the accusation of mocking at sacred things. He had, she says, great admiration for “the elevating effect of Christianity ... upon the weak and ailing,” and “a real liking for sincere, pious Christians,” and “a tender love for the Founder of Christianity.” All his wrath, she continues, was reserved for “St. Paul and his like,” who 
      perverted the Beatitudes, which Christ intended for the lowly only, into a universal religion which made war upon aristocratic values.”
      </blockquote>
    </br>
    Indeed, a certain love of the "historical Christ" yet a skepticism towards the metaphysics, cosmology, and essential components of Christian dogma was popular in late 19th century Germany. This tendency began with the German idealists, continued through David Strauss and, perhaps at a ship of Thesus style stretch of its identity, this tradition could even be cited as an influence on Paul Tillich. Nietzsche throughout his life remained totally opposed to this time and this tendency, which I shall call "moral Christianity".
  </br>
</br>
    While now we may obviously see this as nothing more than an intensification of the protestant disenchanting and distilling of the essence of Chrsitian moral teaching we have to see Nietzsche's oriented understanding of how generally things fit together to isoate and extract the essence of Christian psychological thinking. Nietzsche inverts the moral defence of Christianity in "Geneaology of Morals", outlining the psychology quite clearly and attacking the human behaviours, the "taming of mankind", that it produces. Christianity appeals to the subjigated and oppressed by substitution of a defered eschaton for real social change. Compare Christ's beautification and consolation of the persecuted, meek and poor with the much belinged "God of the old testament", who actually saved their people from Egypt, Philistines and Assyria. Its a shame they don't actually exist, they could have saved Israel before Chrsitianity became possible. But alas...
</br>
    Christian and trans exclusionary radical feminist rhetoric are extremely disimilar, and I am not positing their identity or even general similarity, however there is one thing they all have in common: a veneration of oppression as
    <ul> 
      moral consolation- (the oppressed are good)
      a mark a mark of identity
      
      they operate as a substitute for the violence of self liberation
      
      they resent those in power for their strength
    </ul>
  </br>
    Needless to say neither of these ideologies help the oppressed groups they beautify really free themselves. Compare these slave moralities to Italian autonomist feminism, the anarcho syndaclism of Rudolf Rocker and the Black Panther Party, all of which focused on building alternative powers that could build a new world. All of these have embraced the violence, work and radical seperation necessary for liberation. Rather than demand endless reforms and concessions, they destroy the existing order by building something new through women's, working class and black power respectively. Bizzare Ghandian and self venerating resentment won't help.
</br>
</br>
In "Kant, Capital and Incest Prohibition: a Critical Introduction to the Configuration of Modernity" Nick Land observes famously "Only when the historical bond seperating feminity from violence is broken.....". Land praises Les Guérillères by Monique Wittig as the only feminist work yet capable of imagining the genuine warfare required for women's liberation. In contrast to the claims made by TERFs, feminity is does not have to be a violent thing.
</br>
</br>
Violence and feminity may be polar opposites in Christian, or perhaps all Abrahamnic, civilization, but this is certainly not the case elsewhere. The (in)famous Kali and Shakti of India are examples often given of truly empowered women. However I will focus on someone else. 

</br>

The Goddess Inanna, known to the Assyrians as "Ishtar" (the equviocation was made during the reign of Sargon of Akkad), the Cannanites as Astarte and perhaps to the Greeks as Aphrodite has an extremely complex and interesting mythology. Her parentage is unknown maternally and either Enkidu or Enlil paternally. When Enkidu assigned the domains (mes) to various deities, Ishtar was essentially given "everything else" as a domain, a domain that was outside the clearing where domains were possible. Ishtar even manages to trick the trickster god, Enkidu, and steal the mes (mysterious objects that are what the domains of the gods) and deliver them to humanity, despite never having a "mes" for herself. The text describes her act as morally ambigious:
</br>
<blockquote>
  You have brought us
</blockquote>
<p>
 But undoubtedly the seminal myth relating to Ianna is "Ianna's descent".
